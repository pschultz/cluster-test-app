6 MB Docker Image containing an HTTP Server that echoes the request header and
prints the hostname and port it is running on.

Useful as a "sample app" when testing orchestration / clustering software for
Docker, e.g. to convince yourself that the load balancer is doing what it's
supposed to do, or the rolling release process works as intended.

    docker run pschultz/cluster-test-app /server 8080
